                    A holiday is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, 
                    especially business or work including school, are suspended or reduced. Generally, 
                    holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or 
                    tradition of cultural or religious significance. Holidays may be designated by governments, 
                    religious institutions, or other groups or organizations.

                    The degree to which normal 
                    activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job h
                    eld or personal choices.

                    The concept of holidays often originated in connection with religious observances. 
                    The intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties 
                    associated with important dates on the calendar. In most modern societies, however, 
                    holidays serve as much of a recreational function as any other weekend days or activities.
                    In many societies there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments 
                    and holidays designated by religious institutions.
